This project is an e-commerce website developed using Django, with a strong emphasis on an API-driven backend. It manages essential features such as product listings, shopping cart functionality, and dynamic pricing. The website allows customers to browse products, view detailed information, and manage their shopping cart, with real-time calculations for subtotal, taxes, and total amounts. The backend API enables product creation, listing, filtering, and deletion, making it easy to integrate with other services or front-end applications. The project structure includes views for rendering product data and managing shopping cart operations, with routing defined in urls.py to distinguish between standard views and API endpoints. The models define core entities like Product and ShoppingCart, including methods for pricing logic and sales management. Custom serializers in serializers.py handle data transformation and validation for API responses. The project is built with Django and Django REST Framework, using SQLite for the database. It serves as a scalable and extendable foundation for any e-commerce platform, with the potential for enhancements like user authentication, order management, and UI improvements. This e-commerce solution is designed to meet modern retail needs, offering flexibility for future growth and development.</p>
