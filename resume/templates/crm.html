CRM Web Application Using Django In this project, I developed a comprehensive CRM (Customer Relationship Management) web application leveraging Django. The application includes robust user authentication features, enabling users to register, log in, and log out securely. The core of the application involves creating, viewing, updating, and deleting customer records, all managed through a sleek, responsive interface powered by Bootstrap. Key highlights of the project include: User Management: Implemented secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities, ensuring seamless access control. Database Management: Configured MySQL for efficient data handling and created a robust database model to store customer information. CRUD Operations: Developed full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage customer records efficiently. Responsive Design: Incorporated Bootstrap tables and cards for displaying customer data in an organized and visually appealing manner. Version Control: Utilized Git for version control and deployed the project to GitHub for collaborative development and future enhancements. This CRM application provides an intuitive and user-friendly platform for managing customer relationships, with a strong focus on functionality and design</p>
